		<b>Well, MiM is a programming language :)</b> <small>pronounced like /meme/</small>
		<hr />
		The main purpose of making this language was to provide an interpreted language alongside with those languages that need to be compiled like <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>C++</code> and ... with simple and human readable syntax.
		<br />
		So it will be possible to execute code on a compiled <code>C++</code> program without need of neither build-tools nor compilation process.
		<br />
		Another usage of this language would be general purpose scripting. Something like what <code>Python</code> does.
